Going over operator overloading

* Examing code below:
    cin >> variable;
    
    - The ">>" operator is actually a bit shifter operator
        when not used with the cin object.
    - Using operator overloading, you can change the bit shifter
        into the cin extraction operator when used with the cin
        object.

* Basic idea is to make the operator function a wrapper function 
    around a premade function inside of the class. 

Unary Operator:
    - Only one argument passed in and the other argument would be
    the object.

    return_type operator+ (arg);
    //
