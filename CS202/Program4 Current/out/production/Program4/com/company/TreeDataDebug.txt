Functions implemented:
    * Default constructor
    * --- Helper initializer
    * Copy Constructor
    * --- Copy helper
    * Constructor with List object as argument.
    * Insertion for base cases (first node or match).
    * Insert function that also reorders the lists in it.
    *       //This needs to be edited so that it works with 3 data members rather than 2.
    *

    Insertion algorithm should first insert into a node and then afterwards deal with
    checking if it is full and splitting it. We will also need a base pointer to it's parent.
